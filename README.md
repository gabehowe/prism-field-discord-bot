This bot sprung out of a need for a friend's discord server. 
After dealing with discord.js for a while, I became frustrated at the project's growing complexity and decided to rewrite the entire bot in Python, this time without any kind of discord library.

The original JS bot can be found in the main branch, while the python rewrite can be found in the python branch.
